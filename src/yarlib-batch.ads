--  The batch: every drawn thing is a textured, coloured quad, and every
--  quad goes through here. raylib calls this rlgl. PLACEHOLDER in the
--  seed: Push_Quad reports Ok = False, so nothing is drawn until
--  milestone 1. The window opens, Clear_Background works, and the
--  console counts what was dropped.
--
--  Why a batch: a GPU draws a million triangles in one call and ten
--  thousand calls of one triangle each at a crawl. So we collect
--  vertices in CPU memory during the frame and hand the GPU a few big
--  arrays at End_Drawing. The only thing that forces a new draw call
--  is a change of texture (a call binds one texture), which is why
--  Draw_Call carries a Texture_Id and a vertex range.
--
--  Layout: six vertices per quad (two triangles, no index buffer:
--  simpler to prove, and the GPU does not care at this size). Calls
--  are contiguous, in order, and tile the vertex array exactly. That
--  is Well_Formed, and it is what lets the GPU port loop over calls
--  blindly.
--
--  ALGORITHM (Push_Quad):
--    1. If Vertex_Count + 6 > Max_Vertices: Ok := False, return.
--       (Core flushes and calls again; do not flush from here, the
--       batch does not know the GPU.)
--    2. If Call_Count = 0, or Calls (Call_Count).Tex /= Tex:
--       if Call_Count = Max_Calls: Ok := False, return;
--       else Call_Count += 1; Calls (Call_Count) := (Tex, First =>
--       Vertex_Count + 1, Count => 0).
--    3. Append the six vertices, in this order so both triangles wind
--       the same way: P1 P2 P3, P1 P3 P4, each with its UV and the
--       quad's colour. Vertex_Count += 6; Calls (Call_Count).Count += 6.
--    4. Ok := True.
--  That is the whole milestone 1, and everything on screen depends on
--  it. Then prove it: Well_Formed is the post of Push_Quad and Reset.
--
--  Later milestones extend this file, not bypass it: a texture atlas
--  (so text and sprites share one call), a transform stack for
--  Camera2D (apply the matrix here, on the CPU, per vertex; the GPU
--  port stays dumb), and a "sort by texture" mode for scenes where
--  draw order does not matter.
